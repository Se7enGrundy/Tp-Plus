TP+
===

TP+ is a higher-level language abstraction that translates into FANUC
TP. It features many useful utilities that makes creating TP programs
easier:

* Identifiers for registers, position registers, IO, etc.
* Re-usable methods
* If-else blocks
* Readable motion statements
* Automatic label numbering

Of course adding another layer of abstraction takes you a step further
away from the code the robot is running. However, it's hoped that the
increased productivity and rigid syntax requirements will actually
improve your TP code.
